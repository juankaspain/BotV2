# ===== OPTIONAL: Heavy ML packages (Uncomment only if needed) =====
# WARNING: These packages are ~1-2GB each and require significant compilation
# Uncomment ONLY if you need them for v5.0+ ML features
#
# For TensorFlow (LSTM models, complex neural networks):
# tensorflow==2.14.0rc1
#
# For PyTorch (alternative to TensorFlow):
# torch==2.1.1
#
# For Technical Analysis (TA-Lib requires C compiler):
# ta-lib==0.4.28

# ===== OPTIONAL: Distributed Systems (v6.0+) =====
# WARNING: These are optional and used for distributed architecture
# Uncomment ONLY if implementing distributed features
#
# For workflow orchestration:
# apache-airflow==2.7.1
#
# For message queues (Kafka):
# kafka-python==2.0.2
#
# For distributed computing (Spark):
# pyspark==3.5.0

# ===== NOTES =====
# Python version:
#   - Specified in Dockerfile: python:3.11-alpine
#   - Alpine uses musl libc (not glibc) - important for C extensions
#
# Package selection criteria:
#   ✓ Has pre-built wheels for Python 3.11
#   ✓ Works on Alpine Linux (musl libc compatible)
#   ✓ Pinned to exact versions (reproducible builds)
#   ✓ Tested on Python 3.11 Alpine 3.18+
#
# Build strategy:
#   - Uses --prefer-binary flag in Dockerfile
#   - Falls back to compilation only for packages that don't have wheels
#   - All core packages have wheels available
#
# If you get "cython_sources" error:
#   - This means a package tried to compile from source
#   - Either add it to optional section or use different version
#   - Report to maintainer with the package name
